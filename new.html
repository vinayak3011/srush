SQL injection is a code injection technique that can compromise your database. It is one of the most common webnhacking techniques . SQL injection is the injection of malicious code into SQL statements via web page input . The hacker can retrieve all the user data present in the database such as user details, credit card information, and social security numbers, and can also gain access to protected areas like the administrator portal. It is also possible to delete ser data from the tables . To perform a SQL injection attack, an attacker can use web page inputs as statements through SQL commands to manipulate the application’s web server . The most timeless and effective method to detect SQL injection
vulnerabilities is penetration testing . SQLmap is an open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL Injection flaws and taking over database servers. SQLMap is a modular framework written in Python. It can detect most of the SQL injection flaws across the different platforms. The following databases are supported: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, IBM DB2, SQLite, Firebird, Sybase and SAP MaxDB. After exploitation is successful, it can enumerate databases and tables and also can dump database and tables.

Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext to protect
data from unauthorized access. It ensures confidentiality and integrity of the information.
There are two primary types of encryption:
● Symmetric Encryption: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES,
DES).
● Asymmetric Encryption: Uses a pair of keys – public key for encryption and private
key for decryption (e.g., RSA, ECC).
Encryption is widely used for securing files, emails, and communication. Freely available
tools allow users to encrypt data without requiring extensive cryptographic knowledge.

Cryptanalysis is the study of analyzing and breaking cryptographic security systems. Hash
functions are commonly used in password storage, and attackers use cryptanalysis tools to
recover plaintext passwords from hashes.
Hashcat is a widely used password recovery tool that supports multiple hashing algorithms.
It employs various attack techniques:
● Dictionary Attack: Tries a list of pre-defined words.
● Brute-force Attack: Generates and tests all possible combinations.
● Hybrid Attack: Combines dictionary words with additional characters.
● Mask Attack: Targets passwords with known structures.

Common hash types and their identifiers:
● MD5: -m 0
● SHA-1: -m 100
● SHA-256: -m 1400
● NTLM (Windows Passwords): -m 1000

13.3 Lab Objective: students will be able to analyze real-world cyber incidents, identify
technical and organizational failures, and recommend effective security measures.
13.4 Requirement (Research-Based Study):
● News Outlets: Wired, The Verge, TechCrunch, BBC, Economic Times, etc.
● Cybersecurity Blogs: KrebsOnSecurity, Palo Alto Unit42, Rapid7, Cisco Talos
● Technical Reports: From US-CERT, CISA, MITRE, and NIST

1. Introduction
Purpose of the Study:
This report aims to analyze the Capital One data breach, highlighting the technical,
organizational, and policy-level failures that enabled the incident. The goal is to extract lessons
and recommend preventive measures applicable to modern cloud infrastructures.
Background:
Capital One, a major U.S. bank, adopted AWS cloud services to support its digital operations.
While cloud migration offers scalability and efficiency, it also introduces new security
challenges—especially around misconfigured services and access management.
2. Breach Overview
Timeline:
● March 2019: Unauthorized access to Capital One’s cloud resources begins.
● July 17, 2019: Capital One is notified by an external security researcher.
● July 29, 2019: Capital One discloses the breach publicly.
Key Player:
● Paige Thompson, a former AWS employee, exploited misconfigured cloud resources
using knowledge of AWS infrastructure.
Services Affected:
● Over 100 million customer records were compromised, including names, addresses,
credit scores, and social security numbers.
3. Technical Breakdown
Metadata Service Vulnerability:
The attacker exploited a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in a web
application firewall (WAF). This allowed access to AWS EC2 instance metadata, including IAM
role credentials.
Data Accessed:
● Personally identifiable information (PII)
● Social Security Numbers (SSNs)
● Credit card application data
● Bank account numbers (in limited cases)
4. Security Failures
Technical Failures:
● Misconfigured WAF allowing SSRF
● Overly permissive IAM roles
● Lack of fine-grained access controls
Organizational Failures:
● Insufficient internal security audits
● Lack of proper configuration monitoring
● Inadequate incident response preparedness
Logging/Monitoring Issues:
While AWS did provide logs, they were not actively monitored or integrated with SIEM tools to
detect unusual access patterns in real-time.
6. Recommendations
● Implement least privilege access for IAM roles
● Regular audits of cloud configurations (CSPM tools)
● Monitor metadata access using AWS GuardDuty or CloudTrail
● Patch known SSRF vulnerabilities in WAFs
● Conduct red-team assessments and cloud-specific pentests
7. Legal and Regulatory Implications
● Capital One was fined $80 million by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(OCC).
● Multiple class-action lawsuits followed, citing failure to protect consumer data.
● Raised concerns under GDPR, CCPA, and GLBA regarding cloud data handling and
third-party risk.
8. Conclusion
Lessons Learned:
● Cloud misconfigurations can lead to catastrophic breaches.
● Insider knowledge can amplify attacks.
● Real-time monitoring and proactive threat detection are essential.
Application to Current Cloud Deployments:
● Shift-left security: integrate security in development pipelines.
● Use of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA).
● Continuous training for security teams in cloud security principles.
